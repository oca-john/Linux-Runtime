# linux environment building
> Build my own linux environment, there is some records.
## 1. Desktop Environment
### 1.1 Openbox Setting
> Docky as dock, Tint2 as the panel, Feh to set wallpaper.
### 1.2 Window Maker Setting
> Setting the system dock, Define the menu, Control the Color of window.
### 1.3 Text Mode as Default
> Set text mode as the default mode to enter you opensuse. As openSUSE use the systemd to control it, that is different as the init levels, which confused me such a long time. Now, it's ok.
